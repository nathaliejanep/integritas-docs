## Managing Files

Once files are uploaded in the **Upload** box, they are saved to **My Uploads** for easy access and future verification.

### Delete a File from the Upload Box

To delete a file from the **Upload** box (under the **Analyze** page), click the **Delete** icon next to the file.  
This action will permanently remove the file from both the Upload box and **My Uploads**.

<Callout
  title='Integritas MiniDapp - upload box'
  type='warning'
  className='w-[400px] overflow-hidden'
>
  <ImageZoom
    width={400}
    height={400}
    alt='Integritas MiniDapp - upload box'
    src='/docs/guide-dapp/upload-delete-file.png'
  />
</Callout>

### Delete a File from My Uploads

Navigate to **My Uploads**, then click the **Delete** button in the right-end column.  
This will permanently remove the file from your stored uploads.

<Callout
  title='Integritas MiniDapp - My Uploads'
  type='warning'

  <ImageZoom
    width={800}
    height={800}
    alt='Integritas MiniDapp - My Uploads'

  />
</Callout>
