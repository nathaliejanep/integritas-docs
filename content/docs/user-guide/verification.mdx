## Data Validation

Once the uploaded data is sent to the backend for processing, a pattern recognition algorithm compares data hashes with blockchain records. The system then generates a match report with one of the following outcomes:

- **Full match**  
  The full file’s computed data hash matches a blockchain record.  
  This confirms that the file has not been altered in any way since it was recorded, offering the strongest level of authenticity.

- **Partial match**  
  Some parts of the file’s computed data hash match blockchain records.  
  This means the file contains some verified matches but has undergone alterations. Further investigation may be needed to understand the differences.

- **No match**  
  The file’s computed data hashes do not match any hash recorded on the blockchain.  
  This suggests the file may have not been uploaded to the blockchain or have been modified significantly, resulting in a completely different digital fingerprint.
