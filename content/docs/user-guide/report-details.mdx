## Verification Information

This section provides information about the verification result, the date of verification, and the method used.

## Result

- **Full match**: The entire file content was found on the blockchain.
- **Partial match**: Only parts of the file were found.
- **No match**: No matching data was found.

## Verification Methods

- **Full file**:
  The file was verified using its complete hash.

- **Timestamp**:
  Used when validating TAR files that contain both source and JSON proof files. The system checks the timestamp recorded on the blockchain against the timestamp proof inside the JSON file.

- **Random**:
  The system checked different segments to detect partial matches.

- **Standard**:
  The file was split using predefined configurations for verification.

- **Unknown**:
  Validation was cancelled or failed due to an error.

## File Details

This section provides key information about the uploaded file:

- **Last modified** – The date when the file was last changed before upload.
- **Hash** – The computed value representing the entire file’s content.

## NFT Proof

This serves as a verifiable proof of authenticity for the report.

- If multiple reports are verified at the same time, they share the same **NFT proof**, with an **index reference** linking each report to its proof.
- A **direct link** to the NFT is provided to view the details on the **Minima Block Explorer**.

## Block Dates for Data Matches

Lists the dates when matching data was found on-chain, along with the **number of instances** detected on each date within the corresponding block.  
This helps track when a file or its segments were recorded on the blockchain.

## File Segments of Data Matches

- **Total Size** – The combined size of all detected segments.
- **Pattern Match** – The number of distinct segments found in the data.
- **Match Result** – Expressed as a multiplier, where the first value is the number of times a segment repeats, and the second is the size of the matched segment.

This breakdown helps identify patterns in file sizes and highlights whether certain size patterns occur frequently.

## Unique Hashes from Specific Byte Ranges

This table shows:

- **Start and End Byte Positions** – The location in the file where matches have been found.
- **Hash** – The computed hash for that specific byte range.

This helps pinpoint exactly which portions of the file correspond to each hash, providing a detailed map of where specific data is located within the file.

## All Hash Instances Found on the Blockchain

This table lists all instances where a hash was found on the blockchain. Each entry includes the date, block number, and Proof of Work (PoW) - Transaction ID where the hash was recorded. This enables users to verify the hash's authenticity and trace its history on the blockchain.
