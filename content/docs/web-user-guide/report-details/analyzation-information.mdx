This section displays the core verification details including the verification result, timestamp, and method used for validation.

### Result

The verification result indicates whether your file was successfully found on the blockchain:

- **Full Match**: The entire file content was successfully located and verified on the blockchain.
- **No Match**: No matching data was found on the blockchain. This could indicate the file hasn't been stamped yet or there's a mismatch in the verification process.

  A "Full Match" result provides cryptographic proof that your file's content is
  exactly as it was when originally stamped, ensuring complete data integrity.

### Verification Method

Integritas uses the **Timestamp** verification method for JSON proof files:

- The system compares the stamp recorded on the blockchain against the stamp proof contained within your JSON file.
- This ensures the proof file itself hasn't been tampered with and maintains the chain of trust.
