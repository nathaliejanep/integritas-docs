## Get Proof

### 1. Navigate to My Uploads

Go to **My Uploads** to see all your uploaded files.

- **Get Proof file**  
  It takes up to 3 minutes to stamp and upload the data to the blockchain. To check if the proof is on chain, click **Check Status**. When the data is on chain it will show yes after clicking **Check Status**.
- **Search for files**  
   Use the search bar to quickly find a specific file.

    />
  </Callout>

- **Add file label**  
   Under the **File Label** column, click **Add Label** to tag a file for easier identification.

  </Callout>

### 2. Get Proof file

The proof file is available to download if it is on chain. This is a JSON file that contains the proof, hash, unique id.
This data is later used to verify the file.
