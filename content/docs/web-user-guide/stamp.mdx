### 1. Navigate to the Stamp Page

Once inside the Integritas Web App, navigate to the **Stamp** section from the main menu to begin the stamping process.

    className='w-full h-auto object-contain'
  />
</Callout>

### 2. Upload File(s)

Select one or several files manually or **drag and drop** them into the upload area. The system supports multiple file formats and will process them for stamping.

<Callout

  <ImageZoom

    src='/guide-web/stamp-box.png'
    className='w-full h-auto object-contain'
  />
</Callout>

### 3. Initiate Upload

Click the **Stamp** button to begin the stamping process. Your files will be processed and stamped with cryptographic proofs to ensure their integrity.
