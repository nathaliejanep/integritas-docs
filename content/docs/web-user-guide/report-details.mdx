## Report Details of a Verification

When you analyze a proof file, Integritas generates a comprehensive verification report that provides detailed information about the verification process and results. This guide explains each section of the report.

## Analyzation Information

This section displays the core verification details including the verification result, timestamp, and method used for validation.

### Result

The verification result indicates whether your file was successfully found on the blockchain:

- **Full Match**: The entire file content was successfully located and verified on the blockchain.
- **No Match**: No matching data was found on the blockchain. This could indicate the file hasn't been stamped yet or there's a mismatch in the verification process.

  A "Full Match" result provides cryptographic proof that your file's content is
  exactly as it was when originally stamped, ensuring complete data integrity.
</Callout>

### Verification Method

Integritas uses the **Timestamp** verification method for JSON proof files:

- The system compares the stamp recorded on the blockchain against the stamp proof contained within your JSON file.
- This ensures the proof file itself hasn't been tampered with and maintains the chain of trust.

## Blockchain Details

This section provides comprehensive information about the blockchain transaction that contains your stamped data:

This section provides detailed information about the blockchain transaction and its associated data.

### Block

- This is the specific block in the Minima blockchain that contains the transaction. Each block is sequentially numbered and cryptographically linked to the one before it, ensuring immutability.
- A direct link to the block is provided to view the full details on the Minima Block Explorer.

### Txn ID (TxPoW)

- This is the unique identifier for the transaction, also known as the TxPoW ID (Transaction Proof of Work). It proves that this transaction was mined and added to the blockchain with the required proof of computational work.
- A direct link to the transaction is provided to view the full details on the Minima Block Explorer.

### Date

- This is the exact time the transaction was confirmed on the network. It serves as a stamped proof for any time-sensitive records or agreements.

### Coin ID

- This refers to the specific coin or token involved in the transaction. It can be used to trace the coin's origin and transaction history, providing full transparency of ownership and flow.
