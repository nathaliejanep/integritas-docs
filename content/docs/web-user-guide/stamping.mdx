## Stamp and Upload Data

When data is uploaded to Integritas, a crucial process called stamping occurs. This involves several steps to ensure the integrity and verifiability of your data on the blockchain.

## How Data Stamping Works

Once your data is uploaded, it is sent to the backend for processing. Overview of the process:

1. **Data Hashing**:

   A unique hash of your data is generated. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint, uniquely identifying your data.

2. **Blockchain Upload**:

   The generated hash is then uploaded to the blockchain.

3. **Metadata Storage**: To enable future verification, Integritas saves essential metadata:

   - **Timestamp**: The exact time your data was stamped.

   - **Hash**: This refers to the hash of the data itself.

   - **Proof**: Cryptographic proof that links your data's hash to the blockchain record.

This process ensures that your data's integrity can be verified at any point in the future by comparing the current data's hash against the stamped record on the blockchain.
