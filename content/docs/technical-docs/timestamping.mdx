description: Timestamping adds trust and immutability to the data validation process by anchoring it to a specific point in time.

## Why Timestamping?

Timestamping ensures that the validation records are **permanently linked** to a specific moment, making them **tamper-proof** and preventing any modification after the validation is complete.

By including a timestamp, we provide **verifiable proof** of when the data was validated. This enhances **transparency** and reinforces **trust** in the authenticity of the process.
