description: The Integritas system uses a variety of techniques to compare and validate data using cryptographic hashing methods. These methods ensure integrity and allow for flexible validation approaches.

## Hash Comparison Methods

- **Hashing method**  
  Utilizes SHA3-256 to generate a cryptographic hash.

- **Full data dump hashing**  
  Hashes the entire dataset.

- **Config values**  
  Hashes and compares segments of data according to predefined packets specified in the configuration.

- **Byte-by-byte**  
  Performs a binary-level comparison, starting with exponential segment sizes and refining with increasing segment sizes.

- **Data-by-reference**  
  Matches uploaded data against stored references recorded on Minimaâ€™s blockchain.

## Validation Process

The validation process ensures the authenticity of uploaded data by comparing it with blockchain records.

**Validation results fall into three categories:**

- **Full match**: The data fully corresponds with an existing record.

- **Partial match**: Some segments match existing records, but not entirely.

- **No match**: The data does not correlate with any stored records.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. User Uploads Data

The user can upload one of the following:

- **Source file(s)**
- **A JSON file with proof and a source file**
- **A TAR file** containing both a JSON file with proof and a source file

The system automatically detects the uploaded file type and determines whether to verify the data against the **blockchain** or the **on-chain stamp server**.

### 2. **System Computes Cryptographic Hashes**

The system performs a series of verification methods in sequence:

#### a. **Full Data Match**

- Computes the **SHA3-256 hash** of the entire file
- Checks for an **exact match** on the blockchain

#### b. **Config-Based Packet Size Verification**

- If no full match is found, the system **segments the file** based on the configured packet size
- Computes hashes for each segment
- Compares **segment-wise hashes** against blockchain records

#### c. **Byte-by-Byte Pattern Matching**

- If config-based matching fails, an in-depth **pattern check** is triggered
- The file is examined using **exponential segment sizes**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 bytes
- If no match is found, remaining bytes are checked **sequentially up to 64 bytes**

**Note:**

- **Partial matches** are only checked for segments **up to 64 bytes**
- Any data segment **larger than 64 bytes** is **not validated**
- At every stage, the system **verifies the data against blockchain records**
