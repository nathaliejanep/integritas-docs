title: API Docs
description: This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Integritas API, which enables both uploading and verification of data hashes against the blockchain. It supports optional NFT traceability and returns structured results that include on-chain validation details. Use this guide to understand endpoints, request formats, and how to interpret the verification responses.
---

---

## Base URL

All upload API requests are made to the following base URL:

`https://integritas.minima.global/mmapi`

All verification API requests are made to the following base URL:

`https://integritas.minima.global/integritas-api`

---

## Authentication

Authentication is required for API access to ensure secure transactions and data integrity.

---

## NFT Proof Trace (Optional Feature)

The **NFT Proof Trace** is an optional feature in the API that allows you to request an NFT trace of the verification process.

When enabled:

- It provides an **immutable, on-chain record** of the validation.
- The verification is **linked to a unique NFT**, ensuring transparency and traceability.

---

## Endpoints

There are three endpoints. One for uploading hashed data, one for retrieving proof of uploaded data and one for verifying data.

---

### Upload endpoints

To upload data, (a) hash it, (b) send it, and (c) ask for proof.

(a) Hash the data using SHA3-256 method.

(b) Send it by adding a 0x infront of the hash. You will receive a UID in the response.

(c) Use the UID from the response to retrieve the proof.

#### Upload hashed data
