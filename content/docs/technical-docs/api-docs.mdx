## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

[Visit Integritas API Documentation](https://integritas.minima.global/integritas/api/v1)

---

## Authentication

Authentication is required for API access to ensure secure transactions and data integrity.

---

## NFT Proof Trace (Optional Feature)

The **NFT Proof Trace** is an optional feature in the API that allows you to request an NFT trace of the verification process.

When enabled:

- It provides an **immutable, on-chain record** of the validation.
- The verification is **linked to a unique NFT**, ensuring transparency and traceability.
