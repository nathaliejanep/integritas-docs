## NFT Proof

The NFT Proof serves as the **immutable record** of the file verification process and includes the following key elements:

- **Token ID**:  
  A unique identifier assigned to the minted NFT. It allows users to track and verify the existence of the NFT on the Minima blockchain.

- **Index Reference**:  
  If multiple reports are verified simultaneously, they will share the same NFT proof. The Index Reference links each individual report to the corresponding NFT, ensuring that all validated data remains correctly mapped to its proof.

- **Link to Minima Explorer**:  
  A link to the Minima Block Explorer is provided, allowing users to view the NFT on-chain. This can be used to check transaction details and verify the authenticity of the NFT.
