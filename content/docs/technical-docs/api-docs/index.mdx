title: API Documentation
description: This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Integritas API, which enables both uploading and verification of data hashes against the blockchain. It supports optional NFT traceability and returns structured results that include on-chain validation details. Use this guide to understand endpoints, request formats, and how to interpret the verification responses.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```text
https://integritas.minima.global/core
```

### Example

To make a request to the "Get file hash" endpoint, you would use:

```text
https://integritas.minima.global/core/v1/file/hash
```

---

## Authentication

Authentication is required and done through the use of API-keys. Get yours at https://integritas.minima.global/.

## Endpoints Overview

There are five available endpoints.

### Stamping Data

Three endpoints are used for stamping data:

1. **[Send file and get hash](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/send-file-hash)** - Prepare data to be stamped by hashing it. You will receive the SHA3-256 hash of the data in the response.

2. **[Send hash and get UID](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/send-hash-uid)** - Stamp data by uploading the hashed data. You will receive a UID in the response.

3. **[Get proof](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/get-proof)** - Retrieve proof of stamped data by sending the UID from the previous response.

### Verification

Two endpoints are used for verifying data:

4. **[Verify data (Using source data)](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/verify-data)** - Verify data by sending the source file and optionally a proof file.

5. **[Verify hashed data (Using only proof file)](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/verify-hash)** - Verify data using only a proof file.

| [Get file hash](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/send-file-hash)  | <code>{HTTP_METHOD_POST}</code> | <code>{ENDPOINT_FILE_HASH}</code>        | Generate the SHA3-256 hash for raw source data prior to stamping.            |
| [Get UID](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/send-hash-uid)         | <code>{HTTP_METHOD_POST}</code> | <code>{ENDPOINT_TIMESTAMP_POST}</code>   | Submit an already computed hash to receive a UID that represents the stamp.  |
| [Get proof](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/get-proof)           | <code>{HTTP_METHOD_POST}</code> | <code>{ENDPOINT_TIMESTAMP_STATUS}</code> | Retrieve on-chain proof for one or more UIDs after stamping.                 |
| [Verify with file](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/verify-data)  | <code>{HTTP_METHOD_POST}</code> | <code>{ENDPOINT_VERIFY_POST}</code>      | Validate a source file (and optional proof) directly against the blockchain. |
| [Verify with proof](/docs/technical-docs/api-docs/verify-hash) | <code>{HTTP_METHOD_POST}</code> | <code>{ENDPOINT_VERIFY_POST_LITE}</code> | Validate by sending only the JSON proof file; NFT trace header required.     |

endpoints, see the
